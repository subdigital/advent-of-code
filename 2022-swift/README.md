# AdventOfCode 2022

These are my solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) for 2022.

# Running the examples

To run an example for a day, pass it as an argument to the command line binary:

```
$ swift run AdventOfCode 3
```

This will infer the input file to use (`data/day03.txt`). To pass in a different
input file for testing:

```
$ swift run AdventOfCode 3 --file data/day03test.txt
```
